                    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                    <p>Docker falls under platform as a service (PaaS) sofware that uses virtualization on the OS-level to 
                    deliver software in packages called containers. Containers by themselves are isolated from one another 
                    and hold their own software, libraries and configuration files.</p>
                    <p>This tutorial will take you step by step through a series of labs completed for 4th year computer science,
                        the work and code itself was done in Google Cloud Platform however, there is a setup guide to getting it running on your
                        own laptop but the guide itself is tailored for Google Cloud Platform.

                    <h3>Part 1: Setup</h3>
                    <h4><b>Note: This part is not needed if using docker on an online command line such as Google Cloud Platform.</b></h4>
                    <p>This first initial step is to just get docker running on your pc or mac.<br><br>
                    1.) First, use this link to to download docker onto your device: <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Download</a>.<br><br>
                    2.) Next make sure to select the stable version for your preferred device and click on download.<br><br>
                    3.) Follow the steps of the executable and restart your device.<br><br>
                    4.) Run "docker" in your command line to make sure the it downloaded properly.</p>

                    <h3>Part 2: Creating our first Dockerfile</h3>
                    <p>For this part we are going to build dockerfile and print out Hello World to the console. </p>
                    <p>1.) Create a docker file using this name "Dockerfile.Dockerfile".</p>
                    <p>2.) Enter in the following code into your docker file:.</p>

                    <div class ="code">
                        FROM ubuntu:latest
                        <br>COPY script.sh /
                        <br>RUN chmod u+x /script.sh
                        <br>CMD ["/script.sh"]
                    </div>

                    <p>This code brings down the latest verison of ubuntu and brings inn the script.sh file. It then changes the script.sh file to be 
                    an executable file and finally runs the file on the command line.</p>
                
                    <p>3.) Now we have to create the script.sh file, for this file we simply want it print "Hello World" so use this code: </p>

                    <div class ="code">
                         #!/bin/bash
                        <br>echo "Hello World"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>4.) Now we can build the docker file with <b>"docker build ."</b> the full stop is the directory of the docker so make sure you are 
                        in the same directory as the docker when running this file.
                    </p>

                    <p>5.) Finally we can now run the docker file. First enter <b>"docker images"</b> into the command line to get the id of the docker file.
                        <br>Next enter <b>"docker run (image id)"</b> and you should see Hello World printed out.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Part 3: Docker Pull</h3>
                    <p>Here we are going to learn how to pull down container images and then host docker containers on your local machine.</p>
                    <p>1.) First we need to download a docker image from docker hub using: </p>

                    <div class ="code">
                        <p>docker pull tudjburns/careless-banking:latest</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>2.) Use <b>"docker images"</b> to inspect the image again</p>
                    <p>3.) If you try to run this docker image like the first image you will see that it is listening on port :8080
                        but nothing will happen after than. That is because this is a long-lived http container. To run this container
                        use: </p>

                    <div class ="code">
                        docker run -p 8090:8080 tudjburns/careless-banking:latest
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>4.) Now it is running we want to view it, do to this, on the google console:</p>
                    
                    <div class="code"> 
                        Select Web Preview -> Change Port -> 8090
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Finaly when you see the link, change "?authuser=0" to "getbalance"
                        <br>Link should look similar to this:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <p>https://8090-cs-44288842940-default.europe-west1.cloudshell.dev/getbalance</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Part 4: Docker Push</h3>
                    <p>Here we will learn how to push container images to your own private google cloud repository.</p>
                    <p>1.) First we will need your project ID, to find this follow these steps:</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            Go to Home Page -> Select the Project dropdown -> ID is to the right of project name.
                        </div>
                    <p>2.) Next tag the image with the repository we pulled earlier: </p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <p>docker tag fb794bc844ed eu.gcr.io/"YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE"/careless-banking:latest</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Doing this tag will make it easier to reference.</p>

                    <p>3.) Now we can push the image to our private repository: </p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <p>docker push eu.gcr.io/"YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE"/careless-banking:latest</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>4.) To see if you are successful you can run 
                        <b>gcloud container images list --repository eu.gcr.io/"YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE"</b>
                        And you should see careless-banking in the output if it was successful.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Part 5: Docker Server/ CA1</h3>
                    <p>This Part will show you how to create a python 3 docker image that runs the python http server module. This sections is very
                        similar to part 2 but the contents of the docker will differ.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.) First will be creating the Dockerfile like last time using this code: </p>
                        <div class="code">
                            <p>FROM python:3<br>
                            WORKDIR /project<br>
                            COPY index.html ./<br>
                            COPY style.css ./<br>
                            CMD python -m http.server 8080</p>
                        </div>
                    <p>This code will bring down python 3 to the docker image, create a working directory with the <b>WORKDIR</b> command 
                    and bring in the html and css file into the docker image <b>(Note: these files should be populated before hand)</b>. 
                    The final line of the docker will run the server on port 8080.</p>
                    <p>2.) Now to run and preview the html page it is similar to how part 3 execpt this time we will use the the docker id.<br>
                        Now use <b>"docker images"</b> to find the id for the docker and run this line of code.</p>
                        <div class="code">
                            docker run -d -p 8090:8080 "docker id"
                        </div>
                    <p>3.) To preview the port it will be the same steps in part 3.</p>

                    <h3>Part 6: How I completed this CA</h3>
                    <p>For this CA I split it up into different parts as it would only make it messy if I tried to do it all at the same time.
                        I split it up as html and docker. 
                        <br><br>1.) I started with working on my html page first because this will also bring me back through all
                        the labs we had done for docker and give me a better understanding for it before I try to host the server on docker. This proved
                        very useful when I started on setting up the docker as I had 80% of the knowledge to get it working before I started it. 
                        <br><br>2.) After the html was working I started working on the docker. Fortunately on the docker hub site there is a guide to python 
                        that I put in part 4 which is the only guide I needed to get it running.
                        <br><br>3.) After that I followed my guide to push up my docker images and lastly did the 10 minute video presentation when all other work was done.
